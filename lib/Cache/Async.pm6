=TITLE Cache::Async -- A Concurrent and Asynchronous Cache for Perl 6

This module tries to implement a cache that can be used easily in otherwise 
async or reactive system. As such it only returns Promises to results which 
can then be composed with other promises, or acted on directly. 

It tries to be a 'transparent' cache in the sense that it will return a 
cached item, or a freshly produced or retrieved one without the caller being
aware of the distinction. To do this, the cache is constructed over a producer
sub that gets called on cache misses. 

Sometimes other data that is required by the producer function can be captured 
at creation time, but in other cases they need to be provided at request time,
e.g. credentials. Arguments like these can be passed through Cache::Async 
transparently as extra args.

All caches should have a fixed size limit, and so does Cache::Async of course. 
In addition a maximum global object lifetime can be specified to avoid overly
old object entries. For cache eviction a LRU mechanism is used.

If caches are used in production systems, it is often desirable to monitor their
hit rates. Cache::Async supports this through a method that reports hits and 
misses, but it does not do the monitoring itself or automatically. 

=head1 Constructor

    new(:&producer, Int :$max-size, Duration :$max-age, Duration :$refresh-after, Duration :$jitter)

Creates a new cache over the provided B<&producer> sub, which must take a single
String as the first argument, the key used to look up items in the cache. It can 
take more arguments, see B<get()> below.

The B<$max-size> argument can be used to limit the number of items the cache will 
hold at any time, the default is 1024. 

B<$max-age> determines the maximum age an item can live in the cache before 
it is expired. By default items are not expired by age.

B<$refresh-after> optionally sets a time after which an item will be refreshed 
by the cache in parallel with returning it. This can be used to reduce latency 
for frequently used entries. When set (to a value lower than B<$max-age> of 
course), the cache will upon a hit on an entry that is older than this value 
immediately return the existing value, but also start an asyncronous re-fetch 
of the item as if it had experienced a cache miss. This can be used to make
frequently used items always come from the cache, rather than incurring a cache
hit with the corresponding fetch latency every now and then.

B<$jitter> optionally sets a maximum jitter duration. When an item is refreshed 
and placed in the cache, the timestamp of the item is incremented by a random 
interval between 0 and this duration. This can be useful if your application 
loads many items after boot and wants to make sure that the refresh times 
spread out over time and do not stay clustered together. This value needs to 
be smaller than B<$refresh-after> (and therefore B<max-age>), the default is
zero.

The following example will create a simple cache with up to 100 items that 
live for up to 10 seconds. The values returned by the cache are promises 
that will hold the key specified when querying the cache enclosed in square 
brackets.

   $cache = Cache::Async.new(producer => sub ($k) { return "[$k]"; }, 
                             max-size => 100,
                             max-age => Duration.new(10));

=head1 Retrieval

In order to get items from, or better through, the cache, the B<get()> method is used:

    get($key, |args --> Promise) {

The first argument is the B<$key> used to look up items in the cache, and is passed 
through to the producer function the cache uses. Any other arguments are also passed 
to the producer functions. The call returns a promise to the value produced or found 
in the cache.

With the cache constructed above, the call below would yield "[woot]". The first time
this is called the producer is called, afterwards the cached value is used (until 
expiry or eviction).

    await $cache.get('woot')

Multiple threads can of course safely call into the cache in parallel.

The producer function can of course return a promise itself! In this case Cache::Async 
will I<not> return a promise containing another promise, but it will detect the case 
and simply return the promise from the producer directly.

=head1 Cache Content Management

The following methods can be used to manage the contents of the cache. This 
can for example be used to warm the cache on startup with some values, or 
clear it in error cases.

    put($key, $value)
    remove($key)
    clear()

=end pod

method put($key, $value) {
    $!lock.protect({
        my $entry = %!entries{$key};
        if ! defined $entry {
            $entry = Entry.new(key => $key.Str, value => $value);
            %!entries{$key} = $entry;
        }
        $entry.value = $value;
        self!expire-by-count();
    });
}

method remove($key) {
    $!lock.protect({
        my $removed = %!entries{$key};
        if defined $removed {
            self!unlink($removed);
        }
        %!entries{$key}:delete;
    });
}

method clear() {
    $!lock.protect({
        %!entries = %();
        $!youngest = Nil;
        $!oldest = Nil;
    });
}

=begin pod

As a special case, you can also query for contents of the cache, but without 
calling the producer function on a miss, and without touching any cache 
statistics. This is useful to check for entry existence in cache maintenance 
tasks, but also and primarily when doing operations that violate the LRU 
criteria. For example imagine a cache with limited size over a very large backing 
resource, but with normal operations that show strong LRU characteristics. A
perfect case for a cache, and you can expect good cache hit rates. Now every now 
and then a maintenance task kicks in that traverses all resources. This could also
benefit from the cache, but if it updates the cache it would basically replace the 
whole cache with the tail end of it's iteration, destroying the LRU properties of 
the cache and causing increased cache misses for some time afterwards, a bit like
a cache that is empty. This method allows utilising entries in the cache if present,
but not touching the cache otherwise. Returns Nil if no entry is found.

    get-if-present($key)

=end pod

method get-if-present($key) {
    $!lock.protect({
        # we still need to do this in order to ensure we do not return stale
        # entries.
        if defined $!max-age {
            my $now = now;

            if ! defined $entry.promise {
                return $entry.value;
            }

    });
    return Nil;

=head1 Monitoring

The behavior of the cache can be monitored, the call will return total 
numbers since the last time this method was called (or the cache got 
constructed):

    my ($hits, $misses) = $cache.hits-misses;

Note that the number of hits + misses is of course the number of calls to 
B<get()>, but that the number of calls to the producer function is not 
necessarily the same as the number of misses returned from this method. The
reason for this is that two calls to the cache with the same key in rapid 
succession could both be misses, but only the first one will call the 
producer. The second call will simply get chained to the first producer 
call.

=end pod

method hits-misses() {
    my $current-hits = atomic-fetch($!hits);
    my $current-misses = atomic-fetch($!misses);
    atomic-fetch-sub($!hits, $current-hits);
    atomic-fetch-sub($!misses, $current-misses);
    return ($current-hits, $current-misses);
}
